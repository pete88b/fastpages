            "content": "Overview . nbdev is progressively getting magic commands that will eventually replace the special comments it currently uses, so you get autocomplete and documentation: . . You&#39;ll also get feedback when flags are used incorrectly: . . How do I start using magic flags? . Grab an editable install of nbdev then run nbdev_upgrade from the command line - this will update notebooks that use comment flags like: . #export special.module . to use magic flags: . %nbdev_export special.module . To make magic flags work, nbdev_upgrade might need to add a new code cell to the top of the notebook: . from nbdev import * . You can run nbdev_upgrade any number of times - which means you can update the same project every time new magic flags get added to nbdev. . TODO . apart from #hide and %nbdev_hide, nbdev will ignore flags that are not in code cells - why? . test flags are created dynamically from settings.ini tst_flags . currently both comment and magic flags are supported and you can use both kinds in the same notebook . don&#39;t currently have a plan for deprecating comment flags . Do magic flags work differently to comment flags? . Ideally, they would work the same but ... there is a difference when nbdev splits the source of a cell into flags and code; . If no magic flags are found, treat the first comment line as a flag . . If magic flags are found, the flags part can contain multiple lines . . This could make a difference because nbdev writes just the code part to both the library and HTML docs. .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
